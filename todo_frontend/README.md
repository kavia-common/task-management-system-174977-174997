# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

By default, the frontend calls the backend at `http://localhost:3001`. To target a different backend URL, set:
- macOS/Linux: `export REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3001"`
- Windows (Powershell): `$env:REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3001"`

Ensure the backend enables CORS for `http://localhost:3000` (this template currently allows all origins for development).

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`.

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
